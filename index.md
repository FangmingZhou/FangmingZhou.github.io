### Biography
I am a Machine Learning Engineer specializing in the application of multimodal technologies within TikTok Search. My core professional focus is dedicated to advancing search intelligence through innovations like visual pre-training and integrating multimodal applications across the entire search pipeline.

Previously, I earned my M.S. in Computer Science from the School of Information, Renmin University of China, in 2022. Under the guidance of [Prof. Xirong Li](https://li-xirong.github.io/), my thesis research was concentrated on cross-modal retrieval, encompassing key areas such as modal alignment and cross-modal representation learning.


### News
